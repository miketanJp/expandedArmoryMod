damageSplit: false, subsystemOverridesDamage: false - child damage = parent damage / fragment count (the only option in 1.2)
damageSplit: true, subsystemOverridesDamage: false - child damage = parent damage (new in 1.2.1)
subsystemOverridesDamage: true - child damage = subsystemOverride damage leveled by parent level (new in 1.2.1)

angle: 30, angleMin: 0 - completely random cone scatter between 0 and 30 degrees (the only behavior possible in 1.2)
angle: 30, angleMin: 15 - cone scatter between 15 and 30 degrees, central 15 degree cone empty
angle: 30, angleMin: 30 - all projectiles only ever exit at exactly 30 degrees

angleMin - Minimum scatter angle (0-270, just like scatter angle)

scatterUniformity - Uniform distribution factor (0-1 where 0 is old random behavior and 1 is each projectile evenly spread in a circle)

addedSpeed - Speed added to kinetic projectiles (previously unused)

damageSplit - Whether damage is split per projectile (on by default, determines if parent projectile damage is split per child)

subsystemOverridesDamage - Whether damage of parent projectile is completely ignored in favor of calculating damage from subsystemOverride subsystem (off by default).
Useful if you want a separate subsystem to control fragment damage, without any influence from the parent or its perks/subsystems. Only the level is carried forward if it's enabled,
but kinetic/impact/concussive/heat/stability damage is taken from subsystemOverride.
