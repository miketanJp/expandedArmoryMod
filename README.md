## Expanded Armory Mody (formerly known as fragmentMod)
This repository represents the project Expanded Armory Mod, a modification for the game [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/), a Hybrid Turn-based strategy game by [Brace Yourself Games](https://braceyourselfgames.com).

Formerly known as **fragmentMod**, the main purpose of this mod was to introduce [MIRV Missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle) with different splitting patterns to choose from. the main code project, available to public to meet **Brace Yourself Games' modding guidelines**, has been dismissed since Phantom Brigade version 1.2.0 as it introduces a flexible delayed fragmentation mechanics. from mod version 1.2.0 onward, the mod is using the stock implementation provided by the game.

As a consequence, the mod in that state of things had no reasons to exist. After some thinking, the project has been evolved into **Expanded Armory Mod (E.A.M)**, with a renovated purpose to be a collection of custom weapons and armor sets in continuous development. As the name already suggests, it mains to expand the already existing parts in the game, putting the main focus of expanding the actual list of stock armor sets in the game.

## Main features

- Custom parts/armor kitbash (eliminating the dependency of using stock kitbash)
- Unique visual/attachments

## Parts list (Codex) - [WIP]

- [Armor sets](modCodex/ARMOR_SETS.md)
